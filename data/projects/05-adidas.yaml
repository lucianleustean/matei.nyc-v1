  <p>adidas Samba Pack brings a taste of Brazilian rhythm to the 2014 World Cup. Rambazamba do Brasil was born as the mantra of ‘Die Nationalmannschaft’ for the South American football competition. Germany is all in. All in or nothing.</p>

  <p>The online and design launch of Rambazamba coincided with the new jersey, and it displayed the spirit of the team adopting the new gameplay philosophy. Fast, playful, intense, and made for champions.</p>
