  <p>SXSW – The place tech heads go to network and homeless people go to become wi-fi hotspots.</p>

  <p>So how do you throw a party for 10,000 industry people, and make an agency group relevant? You make it about “Netwerking”; from twerkbuck$ to a gif-dance Kinect installation to special cocktails, we threw one of the most problematic parties in Austin.</p>

  <p>Because real networking happens on the dance-floor.</p>
