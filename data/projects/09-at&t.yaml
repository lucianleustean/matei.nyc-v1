  AT&T wanted something different for March Madness, so we left the bracket building up to the real experts. Six-year-olds.

  What it became was a non-scripted series of videos served up to visitors based on the match-ups and upcoming games. It later grew into AT&T's "It's Not Complicated" campaign.
