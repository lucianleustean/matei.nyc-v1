  CNN 15 Second Debates brought political party viewpoints ahead of the 2013 German Election in the world’s first political debate using Instagram video. The format allowed viewers to get the quickest overview of the key parties and answers to the biggest issues via an interactive and mobile platform.

  CNN International anchor and host of CNN’s “Connect the World” Becky Anderson was the first journalist to launch the platform, and was shortly followed by RTL, n-tv, GP Gazeta Prawna Poland and Expressen Sweden journalists.

  On the #CNN15S site users were able to compare party standpoints as well as comment and score the debates. Users are able to up-vote or down-vote statements, while a simple infographic showed who was leading each debate as well as overall.
