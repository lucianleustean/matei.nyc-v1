  <p>A Russian tank transformed into 7,000 hammers.</p>

  <p>The narrative – from tank to hammer – required a strong focus on digital storytelling. The hype was huge, and all hammers sold out via Facebook before the traditional campaign even began.</p>

  <p>The last 700 hammers were sold in a series of special events under extreme conditions to fans who proved their DIY passion. 10,000,000 Facebook interactions later, the Hornbach Hammer is now a permanent piece in the “Museum der Dinge” (Museum of Oddities) in Berlin.</p>
