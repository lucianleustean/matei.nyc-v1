  Fluchtplan ins Grüne (Urban Escape Plan) for Google Maps is a hyper-localized tool that inspires urban people to explore their green surroundings and find unknown hidden treasures.

  The microsite locates the user’s location and reveals the closest escape route into a green oasis. From a bench overlooking the lake at dusk to the quietest meadow in the heart of the city, Germany’s greenest spaces are shown on the map. A Tinder-like service for nature, users swipe until they find the perfect match for a green space. Online, location-based banners suggest the closest path to wildlife. Out-of-home posters reveal instant ways to find new recreation grounds.

  Instagram celebrities, bloggers and photographers from Berlin, Hamburg, Munich showcased their favorite spots. The initiative increased traffic by 10.3 million visits on Google Maps, and got people to make the most out of summer.
